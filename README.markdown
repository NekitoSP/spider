## Spider

Spider is a Drupal module for my University project. It searches for IT jobs on job boards, adds the new jobs into the database, and shows them on the site with neat statistic information for further analysis, which can be a good starting point for considering to change the study plans in the University to match the modern technologies, and detect new trends in IT workers demand in our local area.

Created with the collaboration of my good friend/colleague, [Nikita Permin](https://github.com/NekitoSP). He is responsible for parsing job boards and saving everything into the database. I'm responsible for the Drupal module itself: settings, custom widget, custom page, and how the data is shown on the site.
